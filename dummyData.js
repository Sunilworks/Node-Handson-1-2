    "What is Node Js" : "As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.Single-threaded non-blocking I/O makes it an excellent choice for both real-time and data streaming applications, too. Node. js is easily employed as a server-side proxy, where it can handle a large amount of simultaneous connections in a nonblocking manner. It's useful for proxying different services with varying response times, or collecting data from multiple source points."
